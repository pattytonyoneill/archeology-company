            <li><em>Do I need an archaeological company?</em>↩
            Short answer? If you are looking at building a public road or a new housing estate or a new feature to your house? Yes. Long answer, “Depends on the scale of the project and how sensitive the region or area you are in.”↩
            </li>↩
            <li><em>Why would I need an archaeologist?</em> ↩
            In the event of failure to hire an archaeologist in an area of Archaeological significance or via the deliberate demolishment of an area of Archaeological significance you can face a fine according to the National Monuments Act. Generally speaking, any feature present within a house or object older than 100 years old is considered an historical artefact. Destruction of these items or features will naturally cause you to face harsh financial penalties. To seek a way to avoid such penalties and to find a happy medium with your local county council or country's  government, then to employ an Archaeologist or Archaeological Company on site is heavily advised. ↩

            <li><em>Where can I apply to work as an archaeologist?</em>↩
            We are currently accepting volunteers, but when the budget allows we will be allowing people into the company itself. Contact us via the "Contact Us" page and someone will get back to you. We recommend using the email to send your email onwards.            ↩
            </li>↩
            <li><em>How can I hire your company to perform a site evaluation?</em>↩
            You can contact us via the "Contact Us" page. Someone will get back to you. For a faster response time, please call between (9am-5pm).↩
            </li>↩
            <li><em>I found an Artefact. What should I do?</em>↩
            Turn the artefact into the National Museum of Dublin or refer to your local laws (if outside the republic of Ireland). They will possibly pay you for the object. Do not sell the object online if you are from the Republic of Ireland or if the artefact was found within the republic. It is illegal to buy or keep the artefact. If the artefact was found outside of Ireland, it is possible to sell the object or keep the object. As laws in regards to ownership of archaeology within countries like America or England do vary. Generally, it is ill advised to buy artefacts online as it perpetuates the illegal antiquities trade and looting of archaeological sites. This unfortunately also perpetuates local and forgien crime syndicates, terrorists, and global warfare within sensitive regions like the middle east. ↩
            </li>↩
            <li><em>I was given an illegally obtained Artefact or know of a seller of illegally obtained goods. Who should I call?</em>↩
            Call your local authorities, specifically groups involved with the collection of illegal antiquities. ↩
